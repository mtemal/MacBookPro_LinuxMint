The files in this folder are what I used to configure grub to work with the Nvidia driverss. 

grub is a backup copy of my /etc/default/grub  
01_enable_vga.conf is a backup copy of /etc/grub.d/01_enable_vga.conf  

sudo update-grub  

Note, screwing this up can break your system. You can use a Live OS to recover your bricked system using chroot:

mkdir -p /mnt/rescue
mount /dev/md2 /mnt/rescue
mount --bind /dev /mnt/rescue/dev/
mount --bind /proc /mnt/rescue/proc/
mount --bind /sys /mnt/rescue/sys/

Properly exiting chroot: 
You have to first exit the chroot session, usually a simple exit will do:

exit

Then umount ALL binded directories:

umount /mnt/rescue/dev/
umount /mnt/rescue/proc/
umount /mnt/rescue/sys/

Then:

umount /mnt/rescue
